					<center><p>ANONYMOUS USER: I'm not too sure how I feel about the art style, but I enjoyed watching this movie with my nephews. Seeing Spongebob and the gang in a different art style made me ponder on how far Spongebob Squarepants has gone from being just a 2d hand animated tv show to being bright and flashy! I look forward to many more years with Spongebob to come.</p></center>
